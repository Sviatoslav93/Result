# Result

The Result is an alternative to exception-based error handling.
It avoids throwing exceptions and instead returns a special result object.
This object indicates success or failure and can hold additional error information.
This leads to cleaner and more predictable code flow.
The Result is especially useful when errors are expected and exceptions are inefficient.
